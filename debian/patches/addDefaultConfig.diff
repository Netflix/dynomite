+#dyn_listen:
+
+# Enable gossip instead of static tokens (default: false). Gossip is

+#enable_gossip: false
+
+# The sleeping time in milliseconds at the end of a gossip round.
+#gos_interval:
+
+# The token(s) owned by a node. Currently, we don't support vnode yet so this
+# only works with one token for the time being.
+#tokens:
+
+# A seed provider implementation to provide a list of seed nodes.

+
+# The timeout value in msec that we wait for to establish a connection to the
+# server or receive a response from a server. By default, we wait indefinitely.
+#timeout: 0
+
+# A boolean value that controls if dynomite should preconnect to all the servers
+# in this pool on process start. Defaults to false.
+#preconnect: false
+
+# An integer value that controls if a server pool speaks redis (0) or memcached
+# (1) or other protocol. Defaults to redis (0).
+#data_store: 0
+
+# A boolean value that controls if server should be ejected temporarily when it
+# fails consecutively server_failure_limit times. See liveness recommendations
+# for information. Defaults to false.
+#auto_eject_hosts: false
+
+# The timeout value in msec to wait for before retrying on a temporarily ejected
+# server, when auto_eject_host is set to true. Defaults to 30000 msec.
+#server_retry_timeout: 30000

+# The number of consecutive failures on a server that would lead to it being

+
+# Encrypted communication. Must be one of 'none', 'rack', 'datacenter', or
+# 'all'. Datacenter means all communication between datacenters is encrypted but
+# within a datacenter it is not. Rack means all communication between racks and
+# regions is encrypted however communication between nodes within the same rack
+# is not encrypted. All means all communication between all nodes is encrypted.
+# And none means none of the communication is encrypted.
+#secure_server_option:
+
+# The address and port number for the REST endpoint and for accessing
+# statistics.
